mturkMatlab: MATLAB Mechanical Turk Toolbox
-------------------------------------------

Toolbox for MATLAB to communicate with Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) using the SOAP interface. The goal of this toolbox is to act as an alternative to the MTurk Command Line Tools allowing you to manage HITs and retrieve results, all while enjoying the comforts of MATLAB. 

The toolbox is designed to be simple and easy to use and is largely modeled around providing the same functionality as Amazon's <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/Welcome.html">MTurk API</a>. The function names and arguments are intentionally kept identical to the <i><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_OperationsArticle.html">Operators</a></i> from the MTurk API to provide a familiar interface for people using other toolboxes.
